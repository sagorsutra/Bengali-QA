ðŸš€ Project Highlights
Multilingual BERT Model
Utilizes bert-base-multilingual-cased, a pre-trained model capable of understanding and processing both Bangla and English. It is ideal for tasks requiring comprehension of Bangla text while supporting queries in English.

Contextual Q&A
The chatbot extracts answers from Bangla news articles by identifying relevant spans of text and returning meaningful answers to user queries in English. The model is trained to handle both brief and descriptive responses depending on the question.

Fine-Tuning on Bangla News Dataset
The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of articles from a Bangla newspaper, with 10% of the data used for training.
The dataset includes:

Text: Bangla news articles
Date: Publication date
Timestamp: Exact time of publication
Kaggle Notebook Implementation
The project is implemented in a Kaggle notebook, leveraging the large dataset for training, testing, and deploying the chatbot.
