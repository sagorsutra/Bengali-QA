This project focuses on building a multilingual Question and Answering (Q&A) system using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), fine-tuned on a custom dataset of Bangla newspaper articles. The chatbot allows users to ask questions in English while retrieving answers from Bangla articles and providing responses in English. This system is designed to work efficiently even with large-scale datasets and is implemented in a Kaggle environment.

Project Highlights:
Multilingual BERT Model: The project uses bert-base-multilingual-cased, a pre-trained model capable of understanding and processing both Bangla and English. This makes it ideal for tasks that require comprehension of Bangla text while supporting queries in English.
Contextual Q&A: The chatbot can extract answers from Bangla news articles by identifying relevant spans of text, returning meaningful answers to user queries in English. It is trained to handle both brief and descriptive responses depending on the nature of the question.
Fine-Tuning on Bangla News Dataset: The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of articles from a Bangla newspaper, where 10% of the data is used for training. The dataset includes:
Text: Bangla news articles.
Date: Publication date.
Timestamp: The exact time of the article's publication.
Kaggle Notebook Implementation: The project is executed in a Kaggle notebook, utilizing the large dataset for training, testing, and deployment of the chatbot.

Key Features
Multilingual Capabilities: Supports English queries while retrieving answers from Bangla texts using mBERT.
Data Preprocessing: Efficiently tokenizes and processes large Bangla text datasets, preparing them for fine-tuning BERT.
Q&A System: Fine-tuned to provide context-aware answers, capable of understanding the structure of both questions and the corresponding text passages.
Scalable: Designed to handle large datasets, although a fraction (10%) is used for demonstration, the system can be scaled up for larger implementations.
Flexibility in Answer Length: Based on the complexity of the question, the chatbot can provide concise or detailed responses.
Steps to Reproduce

Environment Setup: 
Install necessary libraries like transformers, torch, and pandas in the Kaggle environment.
Data Loading & Preprocessing: Load the Bangla news dataset and preprocess the text for tokenization using the BERT tokenizer.
Model Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the multilingual BERT model (bert-base-multilingual-cased) on the dataset using question-answer pairs derived from the articles.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s accuracy in retrieving answers based on a sample of the data.
Q&A Interface: Deploy a simple interface where users can input questions in English, and the system will return answers in English from Bangla text.

Future Work:
Expand the model’s ability to handle more complex questions and answer types.
Increase dataset size for improved model accuracy and generalization.
Explore potential integration with web or mobile applications to deploy the chatbot as an interactive service.
Implement translation mechanisms for more accurate responses when dealing with mixed-language inputs.
